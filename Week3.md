Around 7 hours
## Content Insights
From the linkedin course, I learned about child themes in wordpress.A child theme inherits features from the parent theme while allowing specific changes to be made. Themes can be altered through the WordPress theme Customizer, and widgets and plugins modify content but not presentation. Child themes consist of a functions.php file and a style sheet for customization. They provide benefits such as retaining parent theme updates and easy reversion in case of issues. Creating a child theme is recommended when making changes to the current theme. Additional resources are suggested for detailed instructions on building child themes.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I understand that WordPress assists developers in effectively managing website content and easily editing/publishing web pages without worryiing about responsiveness. The knowledge I have gained in this regard proves highly advantageous for my chosen career path in web development. Based on my experience, I see myself using WordPress rather than Joomla, primarily because my experience with WordPress was more favorable, aided by a helpful tutorial that guided me through the practical aspects. Exploring Wordpress and Joomla has been an interesting journey.
