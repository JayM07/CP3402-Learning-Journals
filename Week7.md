and PHP with MySQL Essential Training

I also completed some exercises from w3schools for practicing PHP

## Estimated Hours
Around 12 hours of learning PHP
## Content Insights

I watched a LinkedIn Learning introduction to learning PHP course. It defined PHP and described how it works with HTML. I gained knowledge of variables, conditional statements, computations, loops, and functions during the course. Through exercises in practice, I also learned about server-side includes and error handling.  My understanding of the utility of writing reusable code, the significance of PHP security, and the proper handling of multiple-choice form fields have all improved as a result of this experience. I feel as though I now have a fundamental knowledge of PHP and how it can be used for building websites.
The "PHP with MySQL Essential Training" course, which I also studied, taught me how to set up project files, add external files, deal with URL parameters, encode dynamic data, edit headers, and construct forms. Additionally, the course addressed the fundamentals of MySQL and how to connect with databases using PHP, including CRUD operations and data validation to avoid SQL injection.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
As I had just briefly touched on PHP, it was helpful to recognise the different syntaxes as I currently deal with a variety of computer languages. It was a little overwhelming for me to grasp portions of this video. At times, it was unclear what we were doing or why we were doing it. I made an effort to focus only on a few key details because slowing down and rewinding the video did not improve my understanding. I believe that this is the case since the 'why' explanation was brief and there weren't a lot of visual representations to improve understanding prior to the demonstration.
