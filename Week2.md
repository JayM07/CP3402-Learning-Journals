## Content Insights
Initially, Joomla proved to be quite challenging to comprehend, and I wouldn't consider it the ideal choice for someone new to content management systems, speaking from my own experience. The default templates offered by Joomla appeared outdated, but fortunately, the provided plugins offered a range of templates that could be customized and modified. Moreover, developers were given the freedom to create a personalized template from scratch. This transition from being completely unfamiliar with CMS to delving into the complexities of Joomla felt like a significant leap, but I thoroughly enjoyed the process of overcoming each hurdle through trial and error. I discovered the concept of creating menus and associating them with the articles I had generated, although I still need to fully grasp the concept of navigation links.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Joomla, an open-source web development and CMS platform, holds the second position in terms of popularity among CMSs, with WordPress being the first. Considering this, I believe Joomla will remain relevant for the foreseeable future, making it highly likely that I will continue using it. Based on my limited experience, Joomla proves to be a decent choice for both front-end and back-end web development. Therefore, if I pursue a career in web development, I intend to utilize Joomla, primarily because it becomes easier to use with practice. Unfortunately, we haven't delved much into the back-end aspect yet, but I am eager to learn more about integrating front-end and back-end functionalities.

In terms of employability, I don't believe companies would hire someone who lacks proficiency in the available resources (CMS) and fails to demonstrate the ability to maintain a consistent workflow. To enhance my skills, I can take the following steps:

1. Gain a deeper understanding of each individual component of Joomla, particularly focusing on links, expired links, and relinking, which have previously disrupted my workflow.
2. Acquire the knowledge and skills to manually create articles, categories, and menus, instead of relying solely on templates. Mastering this fundamental principle is crucial, assuming it is similar to other CMS platforms.
