## Content Insights

I realised that child themes provide a handy approach to personalise and improve the functionality of a parent theme without directly editing its files through the LinkedIn Learning course on developing child themes in WordPress. This assures that future theme upgrades will not overwrite my changes. Understanding the structure and hierarchy of WordPress themes enabled me to leverage and override certain template files and stylesheets more efficiently. I also learnt how to enqueue and change CSS and JavaScript files, which enabled me to add distinctive looks and functionality to my WordPress site. I may make targeted modifications to template files like header.php, footer.php, and sidebar.php in a child theme without impacting the core theme files. I now realise how important it is to create reusable code snippets and custom post types inside child themes. PHP, HTML, and CSS knowledge are required for successful customisation. I also found the power of action hooks and filters, which allowed me to tweak parent theme functions and add my own custom functions to improve my child theme's behaviour. 

I find it difficult to understand the idea that the browser acts as a design canvas. However, I have made tremendous progress in understanding it by watching the recommendedÂ course. Now it's my chance to use the browser and developer tools to construct visually appealing websites. I'm convinced that once I start, I won't be able to stop. One of the most important lessons I've taken away from this training is the incredible potential of CSS in browser design. In this context, having a strong understanding of CSS, including fundamental concepts as well as sophisticated tools and approaches, is tremendously beneficial.
