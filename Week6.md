Around 4 hours
## Content Insights

I learned the need of structure in agile meetings from a course I completed on LinkedIn Learning, which comprises timeboxing exercises to maintain concentration and efficiency. I learnt how to make important meetings like release planning, daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and product demos more productive. The training assisted me in identifying frequent meeting problems and gave solutions for efficiently keeping activities on track. I now recognise the significance of cultivating an agile culture within teams, emphasising cooperation, communication, and continual development. Real-world examples highlighted how agile meetings can be effectively implemented in a variety of projects and organisations, and I learned about particular tools and approaches to improve meeting effectiveness and assist agile project management. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Having specialized knowledge in agile methodologies and effective meeting management gives me a competitive edge over other candidates when applying for new positions or seeking promotions.
Integrating GitHub and Trello with Slack provides real-time updates, streamlined workflow, efficient issue tracking, centralised information, increased visibility, automated notifications, improved accountability, and effortless documentation, all of which improve web development project communication and collaboration.These are all necessary skills required for effective teamwork that the employers look for these days.
