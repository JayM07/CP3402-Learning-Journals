## Estimated Hours
Around 5 hours
## Content Insights
The LinkedIn learning course was really helpful for me in revising my html and css concepts. I learned that in addition to the front-end development that deals with the client-side of a website, web development also includes back-end development. This involves server-side programming and database management to handle data processing, user authentication, content management systems, and other server-related tasks.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Through the LinkedIn learning course, I learned that web apps are cheaper and quicker to build than native apps. As I am more familiar with working with Python and Java, my skills are more suited for my work as a native app developer but as web based apps are accessible to everyone through a web browser, they provide more customer reach. Also I need to stay updated with the latest trends, best practices, and emerging technologies to deliver modern and innovative web solutions.
